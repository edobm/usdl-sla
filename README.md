Linked USDL Service Level Agreements
------------------------------------


Simple vocabulary for describing service level agreements. This vocabulary is based on the work on USDL in the TEXO project.
And was further developed within the FI-WARE project.

Service level module of USDL. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are a common way to formally specify such functional
and non-functional conditions under which services are or are to be delivered. However, SLAs in practice are specified
at the top-level interface between a service provider and a service customer only. Customers and providers can use 
top-level SLAs to monitor whether the actual service delivery complies with the agreed SLA terms. In case of SLA 
violations, penalties or compensations can be directly derived. The USDL Service Level Module allows modeling such
information. The module is derived from our research as part of a multilevel SLA management platform. This vocabulary
defines a simple subset of the original USDL Service Level Module.
